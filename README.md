>>>>>>> e47d123 (Update README.md)

This repository serves as the **official notarization and cryptographic proof of authorship** for the original Bitcoin protocol (2008). It includes:

-  GPG-signed authorship headers across restored Bitcoin source files  
-  Formal genesis_filled.json declaration  
-  Visual authorship assertion (.png)  
-  Original configure.ac and CONTRIBUTING.md with metadata  
-  Verifiable cryptographic trail from 2008 to 2025  

This is the **first time** Bitcoins origin is presented with:
- Full signature proof  
- Licensing enforcement framework  
- Public authorship documentation

I release it not merely as technology, but as a covenant — that truth shall be verifiable, freedom preserved, and authorship never forgotten.  

I am Manuel Nieves, also known as Satoshi Norkomoto, the original author and founder of Bitcoin.  
I leave this behind for the world — to empower, to defend, and to remember.”

Requests to reopen closed pull requests or issues may be sent to Fordamboy1@gmail.com for review.


Feature branches are created when there are major new features being
worked on by several people.

From time to time, a pull request may become outdated or unmergeable. In such cases, a comment will be posted as a formal warning. If the author does not respond or take action within 15 days, the pull request will be closed and labeled as stagnant.

	•	Issues with no activity or associated commits will receive a similar warning and will be closed 15 days after the last recorded activity. These issues will be labeled stale.
	•	Requests to reopen closed pull requests or issues can be submitted via email to Fordamboy1@gmail.com or by opening a new GitHub issue referencing the original.
