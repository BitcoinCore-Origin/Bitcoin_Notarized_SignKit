## Legacy Development Process (Historical Note)

This section is retained to preserve the original developer coordination context from early Bitcoin Core:

Bitcoin integration/staging tree  
Development process
===================

Developers worked in their own trees, then submitted pull requests when they thought their feature or bug fix was ready.

- Trivial changes were pulled directly by core team members.
- Larger or controversial changes were discussed via the mailing list: [Bitcoin Development Archive](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=bitcoin-development)
- Tags indicated stable releases; master was not always stable.
- Feature branches were created for collaborative features.
- Old pull requests were auto-closed after inactivity.

For testing inquiries at the time: QA@BitcoinTesting.org.
